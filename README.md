## About The Project

The challenge was to build a system for user registration. I created a home, login, signup, users, create user and edit user screens. The site is responsive from 414px up. This is the front end of the application. To access the back end, go to the following repository: https://github.com/pedrovsiqueira/2sow-backend. 

### Built With:

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- [ReactJS](https://pt-br.reactjs.org/) - Uma biblioteca JavaScript para criar interfaces de usu√°rio.
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - Visual primitives for the component age. Use the best bits of ES6 and CSS to style your apps without stress.
